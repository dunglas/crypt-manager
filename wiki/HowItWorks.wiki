_Crypt Manager_ maintain a list of encrypted folders, and stock encrypted images on a specific format.


= Details =



==Files==
===~/.config/crypmanager/img/===

_~/.config/crypmanager/img/_ contain all encrypted disk images of folders. The name of the image is the sha256 hash of the folder full path name. It allow to test if a folder is encrypted because a sha256 hash is unique (low collision risk).

===~/.config/crypmanager/cache/folders===

_~/.config/crypmanager/cache/_ contain a file called _folders_ which is a binary serialization of the object "Folders" (the list of encrypted folders) of the cryptmanager.py module.

===/tmp/cryptmanager===
_/tmp/crypmanager/_ is a temporary space for copy/paste/move operations during the encryption and unencryption process.
It also use the sha256 hash of the path to unique the temporary path and it is cleaned at the end of each process.
