#summary Global goals of Crypt Manager
#labels Phase-Design

The goal of Crypt Manager is to provide a generic and easy solution to manage crypted folders on Linux and especially on GTK based desktops (GNOME [1] and Xfce [2]).
The modularization of the code (see _cryptsetup.py_ Python module) allow to easily wrote applications using this encrypted folder management system.
By example, it will be easy to wrote a KDE [3] interface using the module.
